// being able to create tests is extremely beneficial due to the ability to automatically test the features
// present on a website. Instead of manually testing the functionality of our website everytime we change a line
// of code we can instead create tests that will do it for us automatically. Saving a large amount of time.

// Unit tests focus on testing individual units(usually functons), while integration tests make sure everything
// works together
